## What's this

This is a Gradle plugin for automatically generating i18ns string calling code functions for Android projects.

In Android projects, to use i18ns string, you need to define them in `strings.xml` and then call them using `context.getString(R.string.xxx)`, which
is very cumbersome and inflexible.

That's why this project was born.

With this plugin, you now only need to instantiate the `AppLocale` class generated by the plugin once, and then you can use it anywhere.

> Traditional Style

```kotlin
val appName = context.getString(R.string.app_name)
```

> Modern Style

```kotlin
val locale by lazy { AppLocale.attach(context) }
val appName = locale.appName
```

If you are still using Java, the writing method remains the same.

```java
var locale = AppLocale.attach(context);
var appName = locale.getAppName();
```

## Compatibility

The theory supports not very old Gradle, the recommended version is `7.x.x` and above.

Android projects containing Kotlin plugins are supported, other types of projects are not supported yet.

> Build Script Language

- Kotlin DSL

It is recommended to use this language as the build script language first, which is also the language currently recommended by Gradle.

- Groovy DSL

Some functions may be incompatible, support will be gradually dropped in the future, and some functions may become unavailable.
